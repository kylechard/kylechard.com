			My diverse research background shares a common theme of applying computational and data-intensive approaches to accelerate scientific discovery.
			I have a strong interest in the application of service-oriented architectures for delivering scientific capabilities. This approach enables  		
			production capabilities to be delivered to wide scientific audiences without the need to download, install, or operate complex research software. 
			However, this paradigm creates new challenges, for instance, the need to efficiently (in terms of performance and cost) make use of heterogeneous 
			(and potentially large-scale) cyberinfrastructure. 
			To address these needs I am actively investigating autonomic computing methods for automatically provisioning infrastructure 
			and scheduling scientific workloads over dynamically provisioned infrastructure as well as methods to federate resource
			providers using economic techniques.

      <h3 style="clear: both;">Science as a service</h3>
			  <p>Delivering scientific data and software available via internet-accessible services
				is fast becoming a standard model for disseminating scientific capabilities. 
				As part of <a href="www.globus.org">Globus</a> project I have contributed to the design and development of 
				a number of scientific services, including Globus Nexus, a scalable platform service that provides identity, 
				profile and group management capabilities; Globus Catalog, a flexible data cataloging service for referencing,
				managing, describing, and querying large amounts of distributed data; Globus data publication, which supports 
				user-oriented publication of large scientific datasets and self-service management of collections; 
				and the Globus Galaxies platform, which provides scalable cloud-based
				data management and analytics capabilities as a platform.

     <h3 style="clear: both;">Autonomic computing and cost-aware cloud provisioning</h3>
        <p>There are significant technical challenges associated with scaling analyses efficiently and cost-effectively
				across on-demand cyberinfrastructure. We are researching autonomic 
				computing approaches for provisioning cloud infrastructure and scheduling workloads. Our approach leverages
				three core components: a provisioning service, a profiling service, and several cost-aware scheduling algorithms.
				Our stand-alone autonomic cloud provisioning service is designed to dynamically provision cloud infrastructure
				for executing high throughput computing workloads (e.g., using HTCondor and Apache Spark). The service
				makes decisions based on projected execution time and cost, real-time economic information, and current and
				projected workload. Our profiling service is designed to automate the creation of tool profiles, concise descriptions
				of the performance and CPU, memory, network, and disk requirements of a supplied tool under different cloud
				environments and scenarios. Building upon this provisioning model we have developed several cost-aware and
				deadline constrained scheduling algorithms to efficiently allocate workload over provisioned instances
				We have deployed these approaches within the context of the Globus Galaxies project 
				(the platform that underlies <a href="https://www.globus.org/genomics/">Globus Genomics</a>) and 
				have observed significant cost reductions and performance improvements.

			<h3 style="clear: both;">Federated and economic resource allocation</h3>
				<p>Scientists are faced with an increasingly diverse range of options with respect to cyberinfrastructure. 
				However, the task of federating (and even comparing) these providers is challenging. 			
				My Ph.D. dissertation focused on the application of economic
				principles and algorithms to federate cloud providers and other large-scale computing systems (e.g., grids and
				clusters). While many researchers have proposed approaches for federating cloud providers, in all cases two
				important questions arise: who should own and operate management infrastructure? and how can allocations be
				performed securely? To address these questions, we proposed a unique co-operative model (analogous to a grocery
				"co-op") in which service providers collectively manage the federation by hosting various management services.
				To alleviate the potential for subversion, we applied cryptographic secure auctions to enable economic allocations to
				be conducted on potentially untrusted hosts. 
				To asses these approaches we developed the DRIVE meta-scheduler: a service-based economic meta-scheduler that
				creates an open market over a federated pool of disparate providers.
				We have also developed a series of high performance resource utilization strategies that are designed to overcome the performance 
				limitations of using economic allocation techniques.

			<h3 style="clear: both;">Social cloud computing</h3>
				<p>The edges of a social network digitally encode a level of "trust" between individuals
				based on the real-world relationships that exists outside of the network. We have developed models for 
				exploiting these relationships as a foundation for incentivized and trustworthy resource sharing, a model we have termed "social cloud computing."
				A social cloud leverages a cloud-like model for exposing access to resources, relying heavily on the
				principles of virtualization (and sandboxing) to share capabilities (securely) between users. Towards this vision,
				we have developed and evaluated a social compute cloud, social storage cloud, and social content delivery network. 
				Our work has been featured in the 
				<a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/how-facebook-could-make-cloud-computing-better">IEEE Spectrum Magazine</a> and
				the <a href="http://cloudtimes.org/social-cloud/">Cloud Times</a>.

				<h3 style="clear: both;">Information extraction and analytics</h3>
					<p>There is a wealth of valuable information locked within
					unstructured scientific data (e.g., headers, figures, network graphs, etc.). If harnessed, this information can offer
					new scientific insights. Towards this goal, I have investigated methods for extracting knowledge from unstructured
					medical notes and publications as well as approaches for representing and analyzing institutional knowledge. </p>

					<p><a href="http://smntx.org">Smntx</a> is a distributed service based architecture designed to improve accessibility, scalability and 
					flexibility of medical NLP applications. Rather than directly providing NLP capabilities, Smntx leverages existing NLP engines and coordinates 
					distributed access to these tools. Smntx stores and indexes coded results such that data mining and analysis can be performed in real time 
					through a lightweight REST API. </p>

					<p><a href="http://ppdb.uchicago.edu">ChiDB</a> is a structured database of materials properties mined from published literature. 
					To atuomatically populate this database we have developed methods to extract information (e.g., scientific facts,
					methodologies, and discoveries) from published literature. This is a challenging task as information is
					represented in unstructured formats (e.g., free-text, equations, figures, and tables). Our approach
					automatically extracts information from publications, exploits expert crowds to review extractions, and makes
					curated values available via a web service. Our approach leverages machine learning approaches to classify and
					rank publications and the items (e.g., figures, tables) within them. </p>
